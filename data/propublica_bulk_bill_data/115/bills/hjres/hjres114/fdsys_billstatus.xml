          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Constitutional Amendment </b></p> <p>This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment prohibiting the total amount of money expended by the United States during a fiscal year from exceeding total revenue received for that fiscal year, excluding revenue from the issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations of the United States. </p> <p>The amendment also: (1) prohibits the total amount of money expended by the United States in any fiscal year from exceeding 20% of the gross domestic product of the United States, and (2) requires the President to submit to Congress an annual budget in which total outlays do not exceed total revenues received. </p> <p>The spending restrictions do not apply during a fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect, or if three-fifths of the Senate and two-thirds of the House of Representatives vote to suspend the restrictions.</p>]]></text>
