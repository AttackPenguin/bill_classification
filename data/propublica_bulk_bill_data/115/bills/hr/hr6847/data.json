Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2018\n\nThis bill amends the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act and the federal criminal code:\n\n to reauthorize through FY2022 the Sex Offender Management Assistance program; to reauthorize through FY2022 the activites of the U.S. Marshals Service to locate and apprehend sex offenders who violate registration requirements; to reduce the required registration period for certain juvenile delinquent sex offenders who maintain a clean record; to allow states to exempt from public disclosure information about juvenile delinquent sex offenders; to extend the statute of limitations for a minor victim of a federal sex offense to file a civil action; to allow alternative methods for a registered sex offender to comply with the in-person verification requirement; and to limit the aggravated sex abuse offenses that trigger sex offender registration requirements for certain juvenile offenders."
