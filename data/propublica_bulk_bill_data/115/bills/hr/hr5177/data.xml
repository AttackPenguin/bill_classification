This bill authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD) to give preferential selection for DOD contracts to businesses that employ veterans based on the percentage of full-time employees who are veterans.

A business that intentionally misrepresents the veteran status of its employees in a bid may be suspended or debarred from contract competition for at least five years.</summary>
