  <summary date="2018-03-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Tuition Fairness for Citizens Act

This bill amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to make aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States ineligible for postsecondary education benefits (e.g., in-state tuition)&#160;unless all U.S. citizens and nationals are eligible for the same benefit. Under current law, states are not permitted to give postsecondary education benefits to&#160;such aliens on the basis of residency, but are allowed to give such benefits based on other criteria. This bill eliminates the option to give such benefits based on any criteria if they are not available to all U.S. citizens and nationals.

In addition, the bill grants a private right of action to a person who is aggrieved by a violation of this requirement.</summary>
