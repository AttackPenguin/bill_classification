  <summary date="2018-08-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires each executive agency to take into account the existence of qualified training programs of contractors. Specifically, a contracting officer, in evaluating offers for any contract in an amount greater than $25 million, must consider:

 the existence of a qualified training program of an offeror as a factor in the evaluation; an offeror that provides comprehensive training and education programs to develop its workforce, consistent with the agency's needs; and in assessing past performance, the manner in which an incumbent contractor is educating, investing, and retaining the contractor's workforce. "Qualified training program" is defined as:

 a program eligible to receive funds under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, a program eligible to receive funds under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, a program registered under the National Apprenticeship Act, or any other federal program determined by the agency to be a qualified training program. Each agency shall develop workforce development investment incentives for contractors.</summary>
