This bill directs the Forest Service to convey 67 acres of Forest Service land in the Lake Tahoe area in Nevada for the conservation of wildlife or natural resources or for a public park. Subject to the agreement of the permit holder of Zephyr Cove Resort, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) shall modify such permit to include the Zephyr Shoals.

 The Forest Service and the Department of Interior shall convey 7,951 acres of specified federal land to Douglas County, Nevada, for flood control or any other public purpose.

USDA shall implement a cooperative management agreement for the Tahoe Rim Trail North Parcel to: (1) improve the quality of recreation access for such land, and (2) conserve the land's natural resource values.

 The Forest Service or Interior, as appropriate, shall conduct one or more sales of specified federal lands in the county to qualified bidders.

All U.S. interest in 1,945 acres of certain federal land and certain land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or Forest Service (Section 5 lands) shall be held in trust for the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California. The bill designates 12,330 acres of specified BLM land, to be known as the Burbank Canyons Wilderness, as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.
