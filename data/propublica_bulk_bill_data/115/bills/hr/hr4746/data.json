Under the bill, a bank holding company shall be subject to such standards and supervision if (1) the company has at least $250 billion in assets; or (2) the company has between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council\u00a0determines that material financial distress at the company could threaten the financial stability of the United States."
