This bill requires the Department of Labor to identify each fiscal year any states that have reduced their minimum wage or that have reduced a minimum wage increase that would otherwise become effective. Labor must then notify federal agencies that administer programs in such states and such agencies must reduce the funding for the administrative costs of such programs by a percentage equivalent to the reduction in the minimum wage in such states.</summary>
