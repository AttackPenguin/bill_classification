This bill makes it unlawful to transfer or receive an assault rifle during the 60-day period following enactment. An individual who knowingly violates the prohibition is subject to criminal penalties.

During the 60-day moratorium, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives must make recommendations to Congress: (1) on a legal definition of "assault weapon" and (2) on other policies related to firearms that are in the interest of public health.</summary>
