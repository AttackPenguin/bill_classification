This bill makes additional veterans eligible for a temporary disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and access to health care services.

 The VA shall assign a temporary disability rating to certain veterans who file a disability compensation claim and schedule a related medical examination as soon as practicable. Such temporary disability rating shall remain in effect until a formal rating decision is issued.

The VA shall provide hospital care and medical services to such veterans while they are waiting for a formal disability rating. If the VA determines that a veteran does not have a service-connected disability and does not qualify for VA medical services the veteran shall not owe the VA for such services and the VA shall assist the veteran in finding non-VA medical services.</summary>
