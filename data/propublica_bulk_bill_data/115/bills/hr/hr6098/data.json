The bill entitles an employee who is a domestic partner, next of kin of a covered service member, or any individual related by blood or affinity to a covered service member whose close association is the equivalent of a family relationship to leave to care for the service member.\n\nThe bill entitles employees to specified additional leave to participate in or attend their childrens' and grandchildrens' school or community organization activities, meet routine family medical care needs, or care for their elderly relatives."
