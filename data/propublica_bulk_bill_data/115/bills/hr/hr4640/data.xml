This bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to designate public colleges and universities as National Centers of Excellence in Coastal Flood Research and Education.

The purposes of such designations are to: (1) recognize those institutions of higher education that have exhibited national leadership in research and education in coastal flooding, and (2) identify such centers as sources for expert advice and guidance for federal agencies engaged in coastal flooding research and education issues and projects.

NOAA shall require the designated public colleges or universities to enter into an agreement with NOAA to: (1) collaborate on federal flood-related issues with federal agencies; and (2) collaborate and share with specified entities best practices on regional, state, and locally specific flooding and flood-related issues.</summary>
