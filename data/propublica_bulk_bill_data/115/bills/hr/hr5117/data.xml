  <summary date="2018-02-27T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">United States-Israel Joint Drone Detection Cooperation Act

This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) joint research and development to counter unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., drones) will serve the national security interests of the United States and Israel, (2) Israel faces urgent and emerging threats from unmanned aerial vehicles, and (3) the United States and Israel should continue to work together to defend against all threats to their safety and national interests.

The President may enter into a cooperative project agreement with Israel to carry out research and development and joint production of defense articles and services to detect, track, and destroy unmanned aerial vehicles.</summary>
