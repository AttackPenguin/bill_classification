  <summary date="2018-01-25T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness and Camp Hale Legacy Act

This bill amends the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993 to designate the following federal lands in the White River National Forest in Colorado as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System: the Proposed Ptarmigan Wilderness Additions, the Holy Cross Wilderness Addition, the Hoosier Ridge Wilderness, the Tenmile Wilderness, and the Eagles Nest Wilderness Additions. The bill also designates the Proposed Williams Fork Wilderness in such forest as a potential wilderness area.

The bill finally designates certain federal lands in such forest as:

 the Tenmile Recreation Management Area. the Porcupine Gulch Conservation Area, the Williams Fork Wildlife Conservation Area, and the Camp Hale National Historic Landscape. The bill modifies the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness in Colorado to adjust the park's boundaries to exclude 1.5 acres of land identified as potential wilderness to non-wilderness.

The bill directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to permit nonmotorized access and use of the Bolts Ditch headgate and the Bolts Ditch within the Holy Cross Wilderness in Colorado for the diversion of water and use, maintenance, and repair of the ditch and headgate by the town of Minturn, Colorado.

The bill adjusts the boundary of the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado to incorporate 92.95 acres of land. USDA shall include all federal land within the boundary in the Bowen Gulch Protection Area.</summary>
