Under the one-mile rule, facilities are considered to be located at the same site as the facility for which qualification is sought if they are located within one mile of such facility.Specified factors must be taken into consideration by FERC when it determines whether two facilities are located at the same site.\n\nThe bill authorizes an electric utility company to waive the mandatory purchase obligation if additional power is not required to meet customers' electricity needs."
