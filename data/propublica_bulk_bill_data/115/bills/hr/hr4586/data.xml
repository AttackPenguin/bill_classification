  <summary date="2017-12-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Geoengineering Research Evaluation Act of 2017

This bill requires the Department of Energy to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study and develop: (1) a Phase I report recommending a research agenda for advancing understanding of albedo modification strategies that involve atmospheric interventions, such as cloud modification; and (2) a Phase II report that provides specific guidance on governance mechanisms for the proposed research agenda developed in Phase I. Generally, albedo modifications are geoengineering strategies that are designed to manipulate the climate and reduce the amount of radiation that is trapped in the earth&#8217;s atmosphere by reflecting light.

After the completion of the Phase II report, the Office of Science and Technology Policy must report to Congress on an implementation plan for geoengineering research and research governance.</summary>
