    "text": "Emergency Medical Service Providers Protection Act\n\nThis bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to modify the requirements for a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew to qualify as a public safety officer for purposes of death benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program.\n\nSpecifically, it removes the requirement that an individual member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew be part of a public agency or nonprofit entity that actually engages in rescue activity or provides emergency medical services to qualify as public safety officers. Instead, the bill requires an individual member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew be part of a public agency or nonprofit entity that is officially designated as a pre-hospital emergency medical response agency.\n\nThe bill permanently rescinds specified unobligated amounts in the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund."
