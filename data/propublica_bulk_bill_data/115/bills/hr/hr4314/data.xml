  <summary date="2017-11-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No Pensions for Corrupt Politicians Act of 2017

This bill prohibits Members of Congress who have been convicted of certain felonies from receiving pension payments between the date of sentencing and the date of final conviction for the offense (i.e., after all appeals have been exhausted). (Under current law, Members of Congress who have been convicted of such an offense may continue receiving pension payments until there is a final conviction.)

If such a conviction is overturned on appeal, the Members may continue receiving their pensions as normal and are also eligible to retroactively receive the pension payments that were denied under this bill.</summary>
