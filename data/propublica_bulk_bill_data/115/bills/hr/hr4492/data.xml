  <summary date="2017-11-30T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Reauthorization Act of 2017

This bill amends the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 to: (1) exclude the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from specified activities that it currently carries out in conjunction with the the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and (2) increase and extend funding through FY2024.

The Corps shall approve specified water infrastructure projects and issue guidance on information required to be included in applications for projects requiring its approval.

The EPA (currently, the Corps and the EPA):

 may enter into agreements to make secured loans, and shall establish a uniform system to service the federal credit instruments made available; may collect and spend fees, subject to specified limitations, and may appoint a financial entity to assist in servicing the federal credit instruments; shall set aside for each fiscal year at least 15% of the amounts made available for that fiscal year for small community water infrastructure projects; and shall publish pilot program implementation reports on a public Internet site. The bill modifies the date of the Government Accountability Office report to Congress on&#160;&#160;projects receiving assistance under the Act.</summary>
