    "text": "United States-Israel Common Defense Authorization Act\n\nThis bill expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) seek to extend certain provisions of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA) without abrogating the JCPA, (2) ensure that Israel and other allies are prepared for all contingencies should Iran pursue development of a nuclear weapon after expiration of JCPA provisions, and (3) send a clear signal to Iran that development of a nuclear weapon will never be tolerated.\n\nThe Department of Defense shall: (1) conduct a study with the government of Israel on Israel's military requirements to defend itself against Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon, including the extent to which the post-JCPA transfer of U.S. ordnance to Israel would advance the national interests of both countries, and (2) submit the results of such study to Congress.\n\nThe President may, upon Israel's request, provide for the construction of infrastructure in Israel to accommodate ordnance systems designed to destroy underground nuclear infrastructure and store related munitions for U.S. use, or for transfer to Israel's custody under specified circumstances. The President must certify to Congress that such actions are consistent with the results of the study of Israel's military requirements and vital to U.S. national security interests.\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was agreed to at Vienna on July 14, 2015, by Iran and China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and all related implementing materials and agreements."
