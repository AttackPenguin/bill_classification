The board shall manage the permitted cabin land for cabins or recreational residences in existence as of this bill's enactment or for any of the recreation land management purposes.

Reclamation shall convey to North Dakota all U.S. interest in the game and fish headquarters, on the condition that the headquarters continue to be used as a game and fish headquarters or for substantially similar purposes.

The bill exempts the United States from liability for damages, including flood damages, except for damages caused by an act or omission of a U.S. employee, agent, or contracts before the enactment of this bill.</summary>
