This bill restricts the reassignment of telephone numbers during a declared major disaster. Specifically, a number may not be reassigned except at the request of the subscriber during a period in which&#160;a major disaster has been declared. The bill also allows a subscriber to cancel service without a cancellation fee and to subscribe again with the same number with no fee if the subscriber is&#160;located in a disaster area and the disaster resulted in certain types of damage to the subscriber's&#160;residence.</summary>
