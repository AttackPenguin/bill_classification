  <summary date="2018-09-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">PFAS Federal Facility Accountability Act of 2018

This bill requires the federal government,&#160;on the request of a state, to cooperate with the state to address drinking water, surface water, ground water, sediment, or soil contaminated from&#160;a perfluorinated compound&#160;released from a federal facility or a former federal facility. A&#160;perfluorinated compound means a&#160;perfluoroalkyl substance, or a polyfluoroalkyl substance, that is man made and contains at least&#160;one fully fluorinated carbon atom.

Within a year, the Environmental Protection Agency must determine whether to designate perfluorinated compounds as hazardous substances.</summary>
