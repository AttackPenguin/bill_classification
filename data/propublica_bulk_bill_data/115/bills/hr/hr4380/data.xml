This bill amends provisions with respect to the hiring of veterans, members of the Armed Forces, and their spouses.

The bill extends the veterans retraining assistance program, which provides job training assistance to unemployed veterans between the ages of 35-60.

The Department of Defense must establish a database to record training performed by members of the Armed Forces and make such information available to states and other employers to satisfy civilian licensing or certification requirements.

 The bill extends the work opportunity tax credit to the hiring of members of the Ready Reserve or the National Guard or the hiring of the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces. (The work opportunity tax credit permits employers who hire individuals who are members of a targeted group to claim a tax credit equal to a portion of the wages paid to those individuals.)</summary>
