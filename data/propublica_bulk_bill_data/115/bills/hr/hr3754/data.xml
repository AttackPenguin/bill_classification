Program assistance may be in addition to assistance available under the VA Educational Assistance Program.

A participant in the VA Education Debt Reduction Program must agree to serve as a full-time VHA employee for at least three years.

A physician, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, optometrist, registered nurse, physician assistant, or dental auxiliary must agree to serve at least two years as a full-time VA employee in order to receive certain bonuses or allowances.

The VA shall offer employment to a qualified VHA applicant within 75 days after the last day applications are accepted for a position.</summary>
