  <summary date="2018-12-19T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to jointly establish a robocaller bounty pilot program to reduce covered calls. A covered call is generally one that (1) is made by an automatic dialing system, (2) uses an artificial or prerecorded voice and&#160;is not initiated for emergency purposes, or (3) violates the do-not-call-registry.

The FCC and the FTC must provide monetary compensation for the identification and prevention of covered calls and enable participants to share funds recovered from violations.</summary>
