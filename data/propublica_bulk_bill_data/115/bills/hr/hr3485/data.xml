This bill eliminates the contribution amount threshold for reporting the identity of a person who contributes to political committees for federal elections. Currently, a person who contributes $200 or less per calendar year (or election cycle for authorized candidate committees) does not have to be identified by the committee in certain required reports.</summary>
