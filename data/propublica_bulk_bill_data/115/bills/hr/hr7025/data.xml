This bill revises&#160;provisions&#160;that require&#160;the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to operate a program providing individual pre-separation counseling and services to assist members of the U.S. Armed Forces who are transitioning to civilian life. The bill's&#160;changes include (1) revising various deadlines in the transition program, (2) requiring the use of surveys and electronic systems&#160;to track&#160;the progress of participating individuals, and (3) establishing a program to provide Armed Forces members with information about the transition program and about career and educational opportunities available during military service.</summary>
