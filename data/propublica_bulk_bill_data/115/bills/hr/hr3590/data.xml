  <summary date="2017-07-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Environmental Justice and Civil Rights Restoration and Enforcement Act

This bill amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to address environmental justice.

Aggrieved persons may file suit in federal court against agencies that are engaged in unlawful: (1) intentional discrimination prohibited under this bill; or (2) unintentional discrimination that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin.

The President must establish the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice Compliance and Enforcement. The bill specifies the duties of the working group, including: (1) advising and assisting federal agencies in identifying and addressing the disproportionate human health and environmental effects of federal programs, policies, practices, and activities on communities of color, low-income communities, rural communities, and tribal and indigenous communities; (2) developing and publishing a guidance document that defines terminology used in dealing with environmental justice issues; and (3) developing a coordinated interagency federal environmental justice strategy.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must: (1) offer environmental justice training to federal employees, (2) establish grant programs that address environmental justice, (3) establish a partnership-based training program to increase the capacity of residents of environmental justice communities to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects, and (4) establish the Environmental Justice Clearinghouse.

The President must also establish an independent National Environmental Justice Advisory Council to provide advice to the EPA regarding environmental justice issues.</summary>
