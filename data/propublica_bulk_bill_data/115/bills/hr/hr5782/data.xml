This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit a drug manufacturer from engaging in illegal marketing and distribution practices, including falsely advertising, promoting, or marketing that an opioid has no addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining qualities or risks, supplying states or communities with a quantity of opioids that is not medically necessary, or failing to report any order or pattern of orders that would cause a reasonable person to believe the opioids were not being dispensed in a medically reasonable manner.</summary>
