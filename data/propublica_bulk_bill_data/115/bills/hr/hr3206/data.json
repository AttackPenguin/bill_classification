Currently, each community water system must mail their customers an annual consumer confidence report that provides information about local drinking water quality.\n\nThis bill directs the EPA to: (1) require quarterly consumer confidence reports for drinking water systems that include information about corrosion control efforts and exceedances of the maximum contaminant levels and violations of all kinds, and (2) issue a national consumer confidence report to Congress every two years.\n\nIn addition, the EPA must maintain and keep current a searchable website providing access to consumer confidence reports, sortable by zip code and water system."
