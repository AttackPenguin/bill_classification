The FAA may not require an airport owner or sponsor to provide to the FAA without costs any: (1) building construction, maintenance, utilities, or expenses for services relating to air traffic control, air navigation, or weather reporting; and (2) space in a facility owned by the airport owner or sponsor for services relating to air traffic control, air navigation, or weather reporting. (Sec. 148) The bill expands conditions for approval of DOT project grant applications to require projects listed as having an unclassified status to be funded by apportionments. The projects must be for the maintenance of the pavement of the primary runway, for obstruction removal and rehabilitation of the primary runway, or for a project DOT considers necessary for the safe operation of the airport. (Sec. 149) DOT must, in evaluating the master plan of an airport, take into account the role the airport plays with respect to medical emergencies and evacuations and in emergency or disaster preparedness in communities served by the airport. (Sec. 150) The bill defines \"small business concern\" for purposes of minority and disadvantaged business participation in aviation grant programs. (Sec. 151) The special rule under apportionments provisions is revised and made applicable for FY2018-FY2020. Such provisions are expanded to include provisions concerning limitations and waivers and minimum apportionment for commercial service airports with more than 8,000 passenger boardings in a calendar year.
