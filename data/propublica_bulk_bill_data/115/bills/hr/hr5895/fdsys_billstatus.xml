        <text>Mr. Harper raised a point of order against the content of the measure. Mr. Harper stated the provision contained in H.R. 5895 violates clause 2 of House rule XXI. The provision on page 66, line 14 through page 66, line 20, states an appropriation may not be reported in a general appropriation bill for an expenditure not previously authorized by law. The Chair sustained the point of order.</text>
