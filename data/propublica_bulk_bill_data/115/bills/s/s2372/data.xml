  <summary date="2018-06-07T03:59:59Z" status="Public Law">John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 or the VA MISSION Act of 2018 TITLE I--CARING FOR OUR VETERANS Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2018 Subtitle A--Developing an Integrated High-Performing Network Chapter 1--Establishing Community Care Programs

(Sec. 101) This bill revises current provisions relating to veterans' health care to establish a new Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP). This program provides hospital care, medical services, and extended care services to eligible veterans through non-Veteran Administration (VA) health care providers. The VA must coordinate health care to such veterans by: (1) ensuring timely scheduling of medical appointments, (2) ensuring the continuity of care and services, (3) coordinating among regional networks, and (4) ensuring that eligible veterans do not experience a lapse in care or an unusual or excessive burden in accessing care due to errors or delays by the VA or its contractors.

The VA shall provide an eligible veteran with health care through the VCCP if: (1) the VA does not offer the care or services the veteran requires, (2) the VA does not operate a full-service VA medical facility in the veteran's state, or (3) the veteran was eligible for care under Veterans Choice Program criteria.

The VA must report on the types and frequency of care provided under the VCCP.

(Sec. 102) The VA may enter into agreements known as Veterans Care Agreements (VCAs) if health care for veterans is not feasibly available from a VA facility. In authorizing care pursuant to a VCA, the VA must consider factors that would make the use of a VA facility or a community care network facility impracticable, such as the veteran's medical condition, the travel involved, or the nature of the care or services required.

(Sec. 103) The VA may enter into VCAs with state veterans homes. Such homes are subject to all provisions of law regarding integrity, ethics, or fraud and all provisions of law that protect against employment discrimination.

(Sec. 104) The VA must develop access and quality standards for furnishing hospital care, medical services, or extended care services to eligible veterans under the VCCP.

(Sec. 105) The VA must develop procedures to allow certain veterans to access walk-in care through community providers.

(Sec. 106) The VA must conduct a quadrennial market area assessment regarding VHA health care services. Such assessment must consider the demand for VA health care, the VA's health care capacity, the capacity of VCCP providers, and the capacity of academic affiliates and other federal partners that provide health care to veterans.

(Sec. 107) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs' moratorium shall be applicable to VCAs throughout the duration of the moratorium.

(Sec. 108) The VA must deny or revoke the eligibility of certain health care providers who violated VA policies pertaining to the safe delivery of health care to veterans to provide services to veterans.

(Sec. 109) The VA must take steps to improve a medical service line that fails to meet quality standards by increasing personnel, utilizing special hiring incentives and direct hiring authority, providing improved training, and purchasing improved equipment.

Chapter 2--Paying Providers and Improving Collections

(Sec. 111) The VA must adopt prompt payment standards for care provided to eligible veterans. Health care providers must submit claims within a certain time frame and are subject to penalties for fraudulent claims.

(Sec. 112) The VA may compensate a provider for care provided to a veteran, even if the provider does not have a contract or agreement with the VA. The VA must take steps to enter into a contract or agreement with such a provider to cover future costs for care.

(Sec. 113) The VA may recover the cost of care furnished by the VA to nonveterans requiring emergency services. The VA may also recover the cost of care of a nonservice-connected disability incurred by an individual entitled to care under a private health insurance plan.

(Sec. 114) The VA may enter into an agreement with a third party to process medical claims using an electronic interface.

Chapter 3--Education and Training Programs

(Sec. 121) The VA must: (1) conduct an education program to teach veterans about their health care options through the VA health care system, as well as VCCP eligibility criteria and other financial obligations; (2) educate veterans about the interaction between Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, tribal health programs, and VA health care; and (3) inform veterans about the process for filing complaints about health care received from the VA.

(Sec. 122) The VA must develop and implement a training program to educate VA employees and contractors about the VCCP, reimbursement for non-VA community emergency room services, and safe opioid prescription management.

(Sec. 123) The VA must establish a continuing medical education program for non-VA medical professionals. The program must provide the same materials to such professionals as is provided to VA medical professionals

Chapter 4--Other Matters Relating to Non-Department of Veterans Affairs Providers

(Sec. 131) The VA must ensure that all non-VA, nonfederal, community providers are knowledgable about opioid-prescribing practices described in the VA "Opioid Safety Initiative."

(Sec. 132) The VA may share a veteran's medical records with non-VA entities to provide health care and with third-party insurance providers to recover charges for care provided to a veteran with a nonservice-connected condition.

(Sec. 133) The VA must establish standards and requirements for non-VA community providers when providing care to eligible veterans. Such standards and requirements must focus on clinical areas for which the VA has special expertise, including post-traumatic stress disorder, military sexual trauma-related conditions, and traumatic brain injuries.

(Sec. 134) The VA must enter into an agreement with a national network of prescription drug-monitoring programs or any state or regional drug prescription monitoring programs to allow licensed VA health care providers to question controlled substance prescriptions written in participating states or regions.

Chapter 5--Other Non-Department Health Care Matters

(Sec. 141) If the VA requests supplemental appropriations outside the annual appropriations process, it must submit a justification detailing how it will use such funds and the expected duration of the supplemental appropriations.

(Sec. 142) The VA may, beginning on March 1, 2019, use the remaining funds in the VCF for care in the community programs provided at non-VA facilities, but the VA may not use remaining VCF funds for the VCCP.

(Sec. 143) The VA may not authorize care under the VCP one year after the enactment of the Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2018 (i.e., on June 6, 2019).

Subtitle B--Improving Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Delivery

(Sec. 151) This section removes all geographic barriers to telemedicine and protects VA providers against liability stemming from state licensure laws. The VA must report to Congress on the effectiveness of its use of telemedicine.

(Sec. 152) This section establishes within the VA a Center for Innovation for Care and Payment. The VA may implement pilot programs to develop innovative approaches to testing payment and service delivery models for the purpose of reducing expenditures and enhancing the quality of care for veterans.

(Sec. 153) The VA may furnish live donors any care or services required to provide transplants for eligible veterans.

Subtitle C--Family Caregivers

(Sec. 161) The VA family caregiver program is expanded to pre-9/11 veterans. The types of assistance available to family caregivers are also expanded to include financial planning services and legal services for injured veterans and their caregivers.

The VA must periodically evaluate the needs of veterans and the skills of their caregivers to determine if additional support is necessary. The definition of "personal care services" is modified to include services that provide a veteran with: (1) supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury, and (2) regular instruction or supervision necessary to enable the veteran to function in daily life.

(Sec. 162) The VA must, not later than October 1, 2018, implement an IT system that fully supports the Comprehensive Caregiver Program and allows for data assessment and program monitoring. The VA must also report on the status of the planning, development, and deployment of the IT system.

(Sec. 163) The VA must expand its reporting requirements for caregiver programs to describe any barriers to accessing and receiving care and services under such programs and to evaluate the sufficiency and consistency of the training provided to family caregivers.
