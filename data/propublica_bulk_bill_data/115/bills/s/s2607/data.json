An extreme risk protection order is a state or tribal court order that prohibits an individual from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or having control or custody of a firearm.\n\nAdditionally, the bill amends the federal criminal code to expand the categories of prohibited persons (i.e., persons barred from receiving or possessing a firearm or ammunition) to include persons who are subject to a court order that restrains them from possessing and purchasing a firearm."
