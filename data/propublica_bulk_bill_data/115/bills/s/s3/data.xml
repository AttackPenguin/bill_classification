  <summary date="2018-12-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Anti-Pyramid Scheme Act of 2018

This bill&#160;amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to&#160;make it unlawful for any person to establish, operate,&#160;or promote a pyramid promotional scheme. "Pyramid promotional scheme" means any plan or operation in which individuals pay consideration for the right to receive compensation that is based upon recruiting other individuals into the plan or operation rather than primarily related to the sale of products or services to ultimate users.

Furthermore, any person who establishes, operates, or promotes any plan or operation&#160;that sells or solicits the sale of consumer products or services in the home or otherwise outside of a permanent retail establishment, and&#160;that sells products or services to independent salespeople, shall have a bona fide inventory repurchase agreement.

A violation of the bill shall be treated under the Act as an unfair or deceptive act or practice in, or affecting, commerce.</summary>
