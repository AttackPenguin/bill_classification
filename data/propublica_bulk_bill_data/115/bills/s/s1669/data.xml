This bill provides funds through October 1, 2026, for: (1) remedial actions at National Priority List sites (i.e., Superfund sites); (2) remedial actions to address releases of hazardous substances at eligible abandoned coal mining sites; (3) environmental restoration of formerly used defense sites under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program; (4) the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program; and (5) the Diesel Emissions Reduction Program.

The Environmental Protection Agency must prioritize remediation efforts that have the potential to facilitate economic revitalization when providing funding for the remediation of abandoned coal mining sites with funds made available under this bill.

An abandoned coal mine site is eligible for such funding if: (1) the site is described in the Department of the Interior's Abandoned Mine Land Inventory System, and (2) the site's restoration costs are not funded by the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.</summary>
