This bill requires the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to authorize their respective local officials to determine all permissible forms of nonmotorized travel over any permitted routes within their jurisdictions.

The bill defines "local officials" as officers or employees who are the heads of units or jurisdictions of the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the Forest Service, or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

If a local official fails to make such a determination about a permitted route more than two years after this bill's enactment, then any form of nonmotorized travel shall be allowable on that route.</summary>
