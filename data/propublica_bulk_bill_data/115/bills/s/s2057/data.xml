This bill amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to prohibit a pharmaceutical regulator from using his or her position as regulator to influence any matter that provides a direct or substantial pecuniary benefit to a former employer or client. The position of pharmaceutical regulator refers to any officer or employee occupying a supervisory position within the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Food and Drug Administration.

The bill also prohibits such a pharmaceutical regulator from participating in matters involving an individual or entity with whom the pharmaceutical regulator is negotiating&#160;future employment.

The bill expands restrictions on lobbying by such pharmaceutical regulators following separation from employment with a pharmaceutical regulatory agency.</summary>
