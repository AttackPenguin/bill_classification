This bill abolishes the inherently low emission airport vehicle pilot program and revises the pilot program the Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to establish under which sponsors of public-use airports may use funds to carry out activities associated with the acquisition and operation of eligible zero-emission vehicles and equipment.

DOT may establish a zero-emission technology program.</summary>
