          <text><![CDATA[<p>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

The bill funds the GPO at the FY2017 levels. </p> <p>The bill also includes provisions that would prohibit a cost of living adjustment for Members of Congress and require Congressional Research Service reports to be made available to the public. </p> <p><b>Full Summary: </b></p> <p><b>Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2018 </b></p> <p>TITLE I--LEGISLATIVE BRANCH </p> <p>Provides appropriations to the Senate for: </p> <ul> <li> Expense Allowances; </li> <li> Salaries, Officers, and Employees; </li> <li> the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate; </li> <li> the Office of Senate Legal Counsel; </li> <li> Expense Allowances of the Secretary of the Senate, Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, and Secretaries for the Majority and Minority of the Senate; and </li> <li> Contingent Expenses of the Senate. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 101) Requires that amounts remaining in the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account be used for deficit reduction or to reduce the federal debt. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) Exempts agreements, contracts, or purchases by any office of the Senate from the advertising requirement for federal government purchases and sales.
