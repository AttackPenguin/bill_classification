A major rule is defined as one that is likely to cause an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in costs or prices, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, public health and safety, or the environment.

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) must provide guidance on, and oversight of, agencies' assessments of their proposed major rules.
