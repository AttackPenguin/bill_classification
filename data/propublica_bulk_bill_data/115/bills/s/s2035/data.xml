This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to (1) designate voting systems as critical infrastructure and include threats to such systems in national planning scenarios, (2) conduct a threat assessment of voting systems and develop best practices to address such threats, (3) establish a program to award grants to states to implement such best practices, and (4) establish a hacking contest and bug bounty program directed at finding voting-system vulnerabilities.

The bill also directs (1) the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to establish a program for sharing classified information about voting-system threats with state election officials, and (2) the Government Accountability Office to conduct periodic voting-system audits.</summary>
