    "text": "Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2018\n\nThis bill amends federal bankruptcy law to modify provisions related to\u00a0Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which typically involves the reorganization of\u00a0a debtor company's assets and debts. Specifically, the bill modifies provisions governing: (1)\u00a0employee and retiree recoveries and losses,\u00a0and (2) executive compensation programs.\n\nWith respect to employee and retiree\u00a0recoveries and losses, the bill does the following:\n\n increases the maximum\u00a0value and age\u00a0of specified wage and benefit claims entitled to priority payment; allows certain claims for losses\u00a0related to\u00a0defined contribution plans, if the employer or plan sponsor has committed fraud or otherwise breached its fiduciary duty; allows, as an administrative expense of the estate, severance pay owed to employees; establishes\u00a0certain restrictions\u00a0regarding the rejection or amendment of a collective bargaining agreement; revises specified procedures related to the reduction or denial of retiree benefits; requires a court, in approving a sale of business assets, to consider the extent to which a bidder has offered to maintain existing jobs and assume benefit obligations; and modifies other provisions. With respect to\u00a0executive compensation, the bill does the following:\n\n establishes\u00a0specified limitations related to executive compensation enhancements, prohibits executives from receiving certain retiree benefits if such benefits were reduced or eliminated for other employees or retirees, and revises other requirements related to court approval of such compensation. In addition, the bill grants creditor status to labor organizations for purposes of filing a proof of claim."
