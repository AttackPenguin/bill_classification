This bill expands Medicaid and Medicare reporting requirements related to the transparency of physician ownership or investment interests.

Under current law, a manufacturer of drugs, devices, or medical supplies that are covered under Medicaid or Medicare must regularly report on any payment or transfer of value by the manufacturer to a &#8220;covered recipient,&#8221; defined as either a physician who is not an employee of the manufacturer or a teaching hospital. The bill expands the definition of &#8220;covered recipient&#8221; to also include any of the following practitioners who is not an employee of the manufacturer: (1) a physician assistant, (2) a nurse practitioner, (3) a clinical nurse specialist, (4) a certified registered nurse anesthetist, or (5) a certified nurse-midwife.</summary>
