(Sec. 1133) The Corps of Engineers may provide assistance to Indians who have been displaced as a result of the construction of the Bonneville or John Day Dams on the Columbia River in Oregon and Washington.

The Corps of Engineers must carry out a village development plan for tribal villages submerged as a result of the construction of the Dalles Dam, Columbia River, Oregon and Washington.

(Sec. 1134) The bill amends WRDA 2016 to revise the Upper Missouri River Basin Pilot Program, including to require the Corps to prioritize sediment management plans that affect reservoirs that cross state lines.

 (Sec. 1139) The bill amends WRRDA 2014 to require post-disaster watershed assessments in U.S. territories to be conducted at full federal expense unless the President determines that the territory has the ability to pay the cost share for an assessment without the use of nonfederal funds or loans.

(Sec. 1140) The bill extends the expedited consideration procedures for the Senate to consider certain water resources development or conservation projects outside the regular WRDA authorization cycle.

(Sec. 1141) The bill extends the period for which the Corps of Engineers must carry out independent peer review on feasibility studies under WRDA 2007.

 (Sec. 1142) WRDA 2007 is amended to provide that, with respect to the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barriers Project, Illinois, the operation and maintenance of a project authorized to be carried out pursuant to the feasibility study must be carried out at 80% federal expense and 20% nonfederal expense.

 (Sec. 1143) The bill amends WRDA 2007 to authorize the Corps of Engineers to provide credit for work on a project carried out by a nonfederal interest during the period beginning on November 8, 2007, and ending on the date of this bill's enactment if the Corps determines that the work is integral to the project and lawfully conducted.

(Sec. 1144) The bill reauthorizes through FY2023 the Levee Safety Initiative under WRDA 1986.

 (Sec. 1148) In carrying out a project for the beneficial reuse of sediment to reduce storm damage to property under WRDA 1992, the Corps of Engineers may grant a temporary easement to facilitate the placement of sediment.

 (Sec. 1153) The bill exempts a nonfederal interest from the requirement to obtain a federal permit or approval for constructing a water resources development project if the nonfederal interest has a written agreement with the Corps of Engineers that contains the same requirements that would apply to a project carried out by the Corps. However, this exemption does not apply if significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns or compliance have arisen since development of the project recommendation.

(Sec. 1154) WRDA 1986 is amended to require the Corps of Engineers to include in its comprehensive backlog report a list of feasibility studies, projects, and major federal operation and maintenance needs for projects and properties under the control of the Corps.

The bill establishes requirements concerning the public participation process in the development of proposed budgets for water resources development projects.

(Sec. 1157) The bill increases the authorization of appropriations for programs under the continuing authorities program.

 (Sec. 1158) WRDA 1976 is amended to provide that the 15 additional years that the Corps of Engineers may extend beach nourishment at the request of a nonfederal interest begins upon initiation of construction of congressionally authorized nourishment.
