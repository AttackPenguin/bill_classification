The study must make recommendations on potential changes to such principles and methodologies to improve transparency, return on federal investment, cost savings, and prioritization. </p> <p>(Sec. 1104) The Corps of Engineers must develop, support, and implement education and awareness efforts for nonfederal interests with respect to the annual Report to Congress on Future Water Resources Development required under the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014.</p> <p>(Sec. 1105) Prior to developing and issuing implementation guidance for certain water resources development laws, the Corps of Engineers must notify nonfederal stakeholders and allow them to provide input. The Corps of Engineers must consider the input when it develops such guidance.</p> <p> (Sec. 1106) The Corps of Engineers must expedite completion of the Lake Okeechobee regulation schedule to coincide with the completion of the Herbert Hoover Dike project in Florida.</p> <p> (Sec. 1107) The Corps of Engineers must publish information on all real estate assets in the United States that are owned, operated, or managed by, or in the custody of, the Corps. </p> <p>(Sec. 1108) The Corps of Engineers must: (1) undertake research on the management and eradication of aquatic invasive species, including Asian carp and zebra mussels; (2) implement a five-year harmful algal bloom technology development demonstration under the Aquatic Nuisance Research Program; and (3) enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Environmental Protection Agency to facilitate ecosystem restoration activities at the South Fork of the South Branch of the Chicago River (commonly known as Bubbly Creek). </p> <p>(Sec. 1111) The Corps of Engineers may carry out a pilot program to award contracts with a duration of up to five years for the operation and maintenance of harbors and inland harbors if the Corps determines that the contract provides cost savings compared to the awarding of such work on an annual basis.</p> <p>(Sec. 1112) The Corps of Engineers must carry out a pilot program that awards a single contract for multiple hurricane and storm damage reduction projects if the Corps determines the contract will provide cost savings compared to a contract awarded for work on a project-by-project basis. </p> <p>(Sec. 1113) The Corps of Engineers must improve the reliability and the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In addition, the Corps must improve such infrastructure's resilience to cyber-related threats. </p> <p>(Sec. 1114) The Corps of Engineers may provide assistance to municipalities with a water supply that is adversely affected by construction carried out by the Corps. </p> <p>(Sec. 1115) In acquiring an interest in land or requiring a nonfederal interest to acquire an interest in land, the Corps of Engineers must first consider the minimum interest in real property necessary to support a project. In determining the interest in land, the Corps must first consider a temporary easement or other interest designed to reduce the overall cost, reduce the time, and minimize conflict with property owners related to such project.</p> <p>(Sec. 1116) The Corps of Engineers must expedite dredged material management plans initiated after this bill's enactment and make maximum use of existing information, studies, and innovative dredged material management practices. </p> <p>(Sec. 1117) The Corps of Engineers must include in its future workplans certain projects or facilities for disposition.</p> <p> (Sec. 1118) The Corps of Engineers must develop guidance for accepting and using information obtained from a nonfederal interest through geomatic techniques, such as global navigation satellite systems.</p> <p> (Sec. 1119) During the next ten years, the Corps of Engineers must expedite the review of applications from local governments for permits to modify certain reservoirs owned or operated by the Corps. </p> <p>(Sec. 1120) Each district of the Corps of Engineers must provide, if requested, balance sheets of funds for water resources development projects to nonfederal interests that provided funds for the project. The Corps must refund excess funds provided by nonfederal interests for underbudget projects.</p> <p> (Sec. 1121) During the next ten years, the Corps of Engineers must expedite the review of applications for certain easements necessary to access federal land for the placement of water withdrawal intakes in the Upper Missouri Mainstem Reservoirs. </p> <p>(Sec. 1122) The bill addresses the pricing of water storage under contracts with local government entities. Specifically, the Corps of Engineers must limit the rate increase for each unit of water stored in a nonhydropower lake within the Verdigris River Basin.</p> <p>(Sec. 1123) The Corps of Engineers may provide technical services, on a reimbursable basis, to a local government upon request to assess the reasons a federally constructed levee owned or operated by the local government is not accredited by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p> <p> (Sec. 1124) The Corps of Engineers must, subject to the availability of appropriations, pay the outstanding balance for the federal share of the program for providing environmental assistance to nonfederal interests in central New Mexico.</p> <p> (Sec. 1125) The Corps of Engineers may consider recreational boat traffic levels and related economic benefits in making funding determinations with respect to the operation and maintenance of locks on the Allegheny River in Pennsylvania. </p> <p>(Sec. 1126) The Corps of Engineers must provide to an applicant for a water storage project a purpose and need statement for the project.</p> <p> (Sec. 1127) In the case of a project that is budgeted under a different business line than the original line, the Corps of Engineers must ensure that the project follows requirements that apply to the business line under which the project was originally authorized.</p> <p>(Sec. 1128) The Corps of Engineers must expeditiously reset and restore certain levees after the activation of a floodway or backwater feature within the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project through natural overtopping of a federal levee or artificial crevassing of a federal levee to relieve pressure on the levees elsewhere in the system. </p> <p>(Sec. 1129) As soon as practicable, the Corps of Engineers must submit tribal consultation reports as required under the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2016. In addition, the Corps must ensure that: (1) existing tribal consultation policies, regulations, and guidance continue to be implemented; and (2) consultations with federal and state agencies and Indian tribes required for a water resources development project are carried out.</p> <p> (Sec. 1130) The bill amends WRDA 2016 to increase the number of pilot projects for: (1) the beneficial use of dredged material, and (2) the prevention and mitigation of flood damages associated with ice jams. </p> <p>(Sec. 1132) The bill increases funding limits for the rehabilitation of Corps of Engineers constructed dams. </p> <p>(Sec. 1133) The Corps of Engineers may provide assistance to Indians who have been displaced as a result of the construction of the Bonneville or John Day Dams on the Columbia River in Oregon and Washington.</p> <p>The Corps of Engineers must carry out a village development plan for tribal villages submerged as a result of the construction of the Dalles Dam, Columbia River, Oregon and Washington.</p> <p>(Sec. 1134) The bill amends WRDA 2016 to revise the Upper Missouri River Basin Pilot Program, including to require the Corps to prioritize sediment management plans that affect reservoirs that cross state lines.</p> <p>(Sec. 1135) The bill extends the pilot program that allows nonfederal interests to contribute funds for increasing the hours of operation of locks at water resources development projects. </p> <p>(Sec. 1136) WRRDA 2014 is amended to revise provisions regarding the Corps of Engineers providing credit in lieu of reimbursement to a nonfederal interest for the federal cost share of certain projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 1137) WRRDA 2014 is amended to extend through FY2023 and expand the Nonfederal Implementation Pilot Program. </p> <p>(Sec. 1138) The bill prohibits the Corps of Engineers from assessing a water storage fee with respect to water storage in the Upper Missouri Mainstem Reservoirs.
