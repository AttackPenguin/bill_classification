  <summary date="2018-03-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Reclamation Title Transfer Act of 2018

This bill authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to convey to a qualifying entity all U.S. interest in any eligible facility, if: (1) by 90 days before the date on which Reclamation makes the conveyance, it submits to Congress a written notice of the proposed conveyance and a description of the reasons for the conveyance; and (2) a joint resolution disapproving the conveyance is not enacted before the date on which it makes the conveyance. Reclamation must convey with all applicable federal environmental laws before making a conveyance.

"Qualifying entity" means an agency of a state or political subdivision of a state, a joint action or powers agency, a water users association, or an Indian tribe or tribal authority that: (1) as of the date of conveyance, is the current operator of the conveyed facility pursuant to a contract with Reclamation; and (2) as determined by Reclamation, has the capacity to continue to manage the conveyed property for the same purposes for which the property has been managed under the reclamation laws.

Effective beginning on the date of conveyance, the United States shall not be liable for damages arising out of any act, omission, or occurrence based on prior ownership or operation of the conveyed property.</summary>
