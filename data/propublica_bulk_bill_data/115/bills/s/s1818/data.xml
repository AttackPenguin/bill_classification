This bill amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide for the establishment and governance of small business health plans where multiple small business employers pool their employees for the purpose of creating a large group market for health insurance coverage.

The small business health plan must have a plan sponsor who, among other requirements, is established for a purpose other than providing health benefits to its members, such as a trade association, and does not condition membership on the basis of a minimum group size.

The bill establishes requirements for certification, plan administrators, boards of trustees, participation, nondiscrimination, and voluntary termination.</summary>
