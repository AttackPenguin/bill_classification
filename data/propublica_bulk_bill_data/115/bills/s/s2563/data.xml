This bill establishes a pilot project to adjust flood control rule curves at Bureau of Reclamation facilities.

The bill amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to increase access to Reclamation's WaterSMART program by including within the definition of "eligible applicant" any state, regional, or local authority the members of which include one or more organizations with water or power delivery authority.

The bill provides Reclamation with increased flexibility to recharge aquifers.

The conveyance of water through a project facility that crosses Bureau of Land Management land for the purpose of aquifer recharge shall not require a new or additional permit or authorization if: (1) the existing project facility has a valid agreement that allows conveyance of water for a purpose other than aquifer recharge, (2) that conveyance does not result in a substantial change to the operation of the project facility, and (3) the entity operating the facility consents to such conveyance.

In developing any rule, policy, directive, management plan, or similar federal action relating to the issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension of any permit, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement, Reclamation shall: (1) recognize the longstanding authority of the states relating to evaluating, protecting, allocating, regulating, permitting, and adjudicating water use; and (2) coordinate with the states to ensure that any such action is consistent with, and imposes no greater restriction or regulatory requirement, than applicable state water law.</summary>
