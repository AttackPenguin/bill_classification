(A micro-grid system means a stand-alone electrical system that uses grid-scale energy storage.)\n\nDOE must also establish a grant program to carry out projects related to the modernization of the electric grid, including the application of technologies to improve observability, advanced controls, and prediction of system performance on the distribution system."
