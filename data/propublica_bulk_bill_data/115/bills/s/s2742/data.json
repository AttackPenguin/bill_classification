    "text": "Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators Control Act of 2018 or the SARMs Control Act of 2018\n\nThis bill amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to add SARMs (selective androgen receptor modulators) to schedule III. A SARM is a synthetic drug or substance that has effects similar to testosterone. A schedule III controlled substance (e.g., an anabolic steroid) has less potential for abuse than a schedule I or II substance, has a currently accepted medical use, and has low or moderate risk of dependence if abused.\n\nThe bill also:\n\n authorizes, and establishes procedures for, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to temporarily and permanently add a drug or substance to the definition of a SARM; specifies that a felony drug offense includes an offense related to SARMs; and makes it unlawful to import, export, manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a SARM that is not clearly labeled. The bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration to notify the DEA when it determines that a new dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement may contain a SARM or SARM analogue."
