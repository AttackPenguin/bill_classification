This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise requirements concerning repayment options for student loan borrowers. For instance, the bill terminates interest capitalization and origination fees for Federal Direct Loans, provides assistance to low-income borrowers or borrowers who are delinquent on loan payments, and replaces the existing income-based repayment plans with two new plans. Under the new plans, borrowers may choose: (1) a fixed repayment plan with equal monthly payments paid over a period of 10 years; or (2) an income-based repayment plan with monthly payments equal to 10% percent of their income above a poverty level. The income-based plan is capped at 20 years of payments.

The bill also revises requirements concerning student loan disclosures and student loan counseling for borrowers.</summary>
