This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay the difference to individuals who received a deficient monthly educational assistance stipend during a specific time span due to difficulties encountered in implementing amendments made to the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act, commonly known as the Forever GI Bill. Among other things, changes made to the act affected the calculation of the housing stipend amount based on campus location.</summary>
