Under the experiments, ED and the institutions may test the effectiveness of statutory and regulatory flexibility that aims for: (1) an increase in student success (e.g., reductions in student loan debt and increases in student retention and job placement rates); and (2) a reduction of regulations on institutions or ED, without harm to students."
