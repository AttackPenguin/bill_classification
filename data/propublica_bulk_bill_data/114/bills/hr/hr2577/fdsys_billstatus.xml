Requires DOT to maintain a limited operating reserve in the Fund to provide uninterrupted transit benefits. </p> <p>Provides appropriations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for: Operations; Facilities and Equipment; Research, Engineering, and Development; and Grants-In-Aid For Airports. </p> <p>Prohibits the use of funds provided by this bill for: new applicants for the second career training program, new unauthorized user fees, or aeronautical charting and cartography activities through the Working Capital Fund. </p> <p>Permits funds received from specified public, private, and foreign sources for expenses incurred to be credited to the appropriation. </p> <p>Requires DOT to submit to Congress a five-year capital investment plan for the FAA. </p> <p>Permits funds to be used for installation and commissioning or runway incursion prevention devices and systems. </p> <p>(Sec. 110) Limit technical staff years under the federally funded research and development center contract between the FAA and the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development. </p> <p>(Sec. 111) Prohibits the FAA from requiring airport sponsors to provide the agency without cost building construction, maintenance, utilities and expenses, or space in sponsor-owned buildings for air traffic control, air navigation, or weather reporting, except for specified exceptions. </p> <p>(Sec. 112) Permits the FAA to reimburse amounts made available from certain fees to carry out the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, which ensures that small communities have a minimum level of air service. </p> <p>(Sec. 113) Permits amounts collected by the FAA for providing technical assistance to foreign aviation authorities to be credited to the Operations account. </p> <p>(Sec. 114) Prohibits the FAA from paying Sunday premium pay except if an individual worked on a Sunday. </p> <p>(Sec. 115) Prohibits the FAA from using funds provided by this bill to purchase a store gift card or gift certificate using a government-issued credit card. </p> <p>(Sec. 116) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used for retention bonuses for FAA employees without prior approval of the Assistant Secretary for Administration of DOT.</p> <p> (Sec. 117) Requires the FAA to block the display of an owner's or operator's aircraft registration number in the Aircraft Situational Display to Industry data program, upon the request of an owner or operator. </p> <p>(Sec. 118) Prohibits the use of funds provided by this bill to pay the salaries and expenses of more than nine political or presidential FAA appointees. </p> <p>(Sec. 119) Prohibits the use of funds provided by this bill to increase fees for navigation products until the FAA provides Congress with a justification for all fees for aeronautical navigation products. </p> <p>(Sec. 119A) Requires the FAA to notify Congress prior to closing a regional operations center or reducing the services it provides. </p> <p>(Sec. 119B) Prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used to change weight restrictions or prior permission rules at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. </p> <p>Provides funding from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for Administrative Expenses and Federal-Aid Highways. </p> <p>(Most of DOT's budget is mandatory budget authority rather than discretionary budget authority. The mandatory budget authority is primarily in the form of contract authority derived from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Contract authority is the authority to obligate funds in advance of an appropriation Act. </p> <p>Spending from the HTF is determined both by authorization bills and appropriations bills. Authorization bills provide contract authority for highway programs, and appropriations bills include obligation limitations that determine how much of the contract authority may be used in a given
