This is the expansion of the Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project described in the Upper Hidden Basin Grant Application dated July 2, 2014, as submitted by Kodiak Electric Association, Inc., to the Alaska Energy Authority Renewable Energy Fund Round VIII.

The Expansion must meet the terms and conditions contained in any amendment to a license which may be issued by FERC subsequent to its environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.</summary>
