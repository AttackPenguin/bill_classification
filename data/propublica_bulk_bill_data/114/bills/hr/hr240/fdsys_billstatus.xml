        <text>Floor summary: DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Israel motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to provide for a clean funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that does not include dangerous, poison pill amendments. Given recent events overseas, this is not a time to endanger the safety and security of the American people. The House needs to pass a clean bill that would provide certainty to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Additionally, the motion increases funding for the DHS State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative program by $1.5 million each (for a total of $3 million) and reduces the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management account by the same amount.</text>
