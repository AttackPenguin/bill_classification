        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Esty motion to recommit with instructions, pending reservation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment that would guarantee educational opportunities for children with disabilities by requiring that each state: (1) demonstrate their laws do not result in a lower standard of education than for those students without disabilities; (2) grant students with disabilities access to a regular secondary school diploma; (3) give parents the right to informed consent about their childs education; (4) cannot lower expectations or academic achievement for students with disabilities; or (5) give educational opportunities for any student, including those from racial and ethnic minorities. Additionally, the motion requires the Secretary of Education to regulate learning environments                in order to protect children with disabilitie s from abusive                seclusion and restraint practi ces.</text>

        <description>An amendment No. 37 printed in part B of House Report 114-29 to ensure that federal education dollars go toward their intended use for student benefit in the classroom by clarifying that funds received under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act shall not be diverted by the states to fill prior unfunded liability shortfalls in teacher pension programs. When a state receives funds under ESEA and distributes those funds to LEAs, the amendment prohibits the state from requiring LEAs to make a contribution to a pension program that is in excess of the "normal cost" of that teacher's participation in the pension program.</description>

        <description>An amendment numbered 9 printed in Part B of House Report 114-29 to restore the paraprofessional qualifications that are in place under current law, which helped stop school districts from hiring paraprofessionals with little experience in education and no professional training. Since all districts are in compliance, and have been since 2006, this amendment would present no new burden.</description>
