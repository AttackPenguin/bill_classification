This bill requires state and local law enforcement agencies to require and enforce the use of body-worn and dashboard cameras, as an eligibility condition for a state to receive funds under Department of Justice (DOJ) grant programs that provide amounts for law enforcement purposes.

DOJ must reduce by 10% the allocation of grant funds for a state that fails to certify the full compliance of its state and local law enforcement agencies.</summary>
