This bill amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) to allow the use of arbitration to resolve a controversy that arises under a contract with a servicemember (or with a servicemember and spouse jointly) that provides for arbitration, only if all parties to the controversy consent in writing to arbitration after the controversy arises.

A servicemember's waiver of any SCRA rights and protections shall be effective only if it is made after a specific dispute has arisen and is identified in the waiver.

A representative of members of an aggrieved class, or a member of the class, may bring a private civil action for a violation of any SCRA rights or protections.</summary>
