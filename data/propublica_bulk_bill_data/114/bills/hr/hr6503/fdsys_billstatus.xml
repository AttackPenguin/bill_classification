          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Care for Life Act </strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and maintain the Pregnant and Parenting Women's Care Information Service database. This database must provide pregnant women and new parents with information on public and private service providers that help such women and parents in alleviating the physical, financial, social, and emotional difficulties encountered during or after pregnancy. </p> <p>HHS may award grants to: (1) providers to develop best practices for communities to identify optimal ways to provide pregnancy and parenting support services, and (2) academic medical centers to provide specialized training in pregnancy and parenting support services. </p> <p>The Department of Labor must recognize and publicize the practices of employers who successfully meet the needs of their pregnant or parenting employees. </p> <p>The grant program of the Department of Education to improve postsecondary education opportunities is expanded to include funding for the development of an online information toolkit about agencies that are working within institutions of higher education to provide pregnancy and child care services for students. </p>]]></text>
