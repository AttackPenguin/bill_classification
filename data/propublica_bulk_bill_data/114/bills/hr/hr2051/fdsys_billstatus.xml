          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015</b></p> <p> This bill reauthorizes and amends laws that address livestock mandatory price reporting requirements, funding for the National Forest Foundation, and procedures for weighing and inspecting grain.</p> <p> TITLE I--MANDATORY PRICE REPORTING </p> <p>This bill amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to extend and revise the Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) livestock mandatory price reporting requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 101) The bill extends the authority for continuing mandatory livestock price reporting through FY2020. Current authority expires at the end of FY2015. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) USDA must begin reporting specified price details regarding certain negotiated purchases of swine. USDA must include required information that occurs after the afternoon reporting deadline in reports for the next day. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) USDA must revise regulations to modify the definitions of &quot;packer&quot; and &quot;importers&quot; for the purpose of lamb reporting requirements. </p> <p>USDA must include only importers that imported an average of 1,000 metric tons of lamb meat products per year during the previous four years, or importers that USDA determines should be included based on the volume of lamb imports. </p> <p>The term &quot;packer&quot; applies to any entity with at least 50% ownership in a facility and includes a federally inspected processing plant that slaughtered or processed the equivalent of an average of 35,000 head of lambs per year during the previous five years. USDA may include other processing plants that should be considered packers based on capacity. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service must consult with relevant market participants to study and report to Congress on the implementation of livestock mandatory price reporting. </p> <p>TITLE II--NATIONAL FOREST FOUNDATION ACT REAUTHORIZATION </p> <p>(Sec. 201) This bill amends the National Forest Foundation Act to authorize USDA to provide matching funds for certain administrative and project expenses incurred by the National Forest Foundation for FY2016-FY2018. </p> <p>TITLE III--UNITED STATES GRAIN STANDARDS ACT REAUTHORIZATION </p> <p>This bill reauthorizes and amends provisions of the United States Grain Standards Act. The Act authorizes USDA to establish official marketing standards for grains, and to provide procedures for grain inspection and weighing. The bill reauthorizes several expiring provisions through FY2020, establishes procedures in the event of an interruption of inspection and weighing services, revises the process for delegating inspections to state agencies, and revises fees for inspection and weighing services. </p> <p>(Sec. 301) The bill revises USDA's discretionary authority to waive weighing and inspection requirements in emergency circumstances to require a waiver in an emergency.
