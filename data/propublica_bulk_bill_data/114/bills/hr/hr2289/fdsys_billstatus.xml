          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Commodity End User Relief Act</b></p> <p> Amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to direct registered futures associations to require their futures commission merchant members to:</p> <ul> <li>maintain written policies and procedures governing maintenance of members&rsquo; specified residual interests in customer segregated funds accounts, including cleared swaps customer collateral accounts; and</li> <li>establish rules governing the withdrawal, transfer, or disbursement of a member's residual interest in customer segregated funds, in foreign futures and foreign options customer secured amount funds, and from a cleared swaps customer collateral.</li> </ul> <p>Authorizes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to require that property of the bankruptcy estate, including trading or operating accounts and commodities held in inventory, of a commodity broker who is a Chapter 7 debtor in bankruptcy be included in customer property to the extent that such property is insufficient to satisfy the net equity claims of the broker's public customers. </p> <p> Extends authority for CFTC operations. Amends the CEA to revise the requirement that the CFTC, before promulgating a regulation or issuing an order, consider the costs and benefits of the action. </p> <p>Requires the CFTC, through the Office of the Chief Economist (established by this Act), to: (1) assess and publish the costs and benefits, both qualitative and quantitative, of the proposed regulation; and (2) require the proposed regulation or order to state its statutory justification.</p> <p>Requires the CFTC to submit every five years to certain congressional committees a detailed strategic technology plan focused on its acquisition and use of technology.</p> <p>Requires CFTC staff to develop comprehensive internal risk control mechanisms to safeguard and govern the storage of all market data, including CFTC market data sharing agreements, and academic research performed at the CFTC using market data.</p> <p>Directs the Government Accountability Office, among other things, to: <ul> <li>assess whether CFTC resources are sufficient to enable the CFTC to carry out its duties effectively; and </li> <li>examine prior CFTC expenditures on hardware, software, and analytical processes to protect customers in the areas of market surveillance and risk detection, and market data collection, aggregation, interpretation, standardization, harmonization, and streamlining.</li> </ul> <p>Revises the treatment of affiliate transactions that may be exempt from clearing requirements to authorize such an exemption only if such affiliate enters into the swap to hedge or mitigate the commercial risk of the person that is not a financial entity (as under current law), except that if the hedge or mitigation of the commercial risk is addressed by entering into a swap with a swap dealer or major swap participant, an appropriate credit support measure or other mechanism must be utilized.</p> <p> Prescribes reporting requirements for transactions in utility operations-related swaps.</p> <p>Requires the CFTC, in determining whether to exempt from designation as a swap dealer an entity that engages in a de minimis quantity of swap dealing, to treat a utility operations-related swap entered into with a utility special entity as if the entity were not a special entity.</p> <p>Excludes from the definition of financial entity subject to clearing requirements specified entities that are not supervised by a prudential regulator, yet are commercial market participants deemed to be a financial entity because they: (1) predominantly engage in physical delivery contracts;

certain investment trusts and syndicates that are excluded from the definition of &quot;investment company&quot; under the Investment Company Act of 1940. <p>Exempts certain qualified charitable organizations and their employees, acting within the scope of their employment or duties, from designation and regulation as commodity pool operators subject to registration requirements. <p>(Sec. 316) States that any CFTC determination exempting a small bank or savings association from the treatment as a financial entity also applies to the bank's or association's holding company if the holding company's total consolidated assets do not exceed the asset threshold set by the CFTC for defining a small bank and savings association. <p>(Sec. 317) Repeals the requirement that a swap execution facility provide by its rules that, when a swap dealer or major swap participant enters into or facilitates a swap subject to the mandatory clearing requirement, the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be responsible for compliance with a specified mandatory trading requirement. <p>Grants a swap execution facility, instead, discretion in establishing and enforcing its rules concerning trade practice surveillance, market surveillance, real-time marketing monitoring, and audit trail given that a swap execution facility may offer a trading system or platform to execute or trade swaps through any means of interstate commerce<em>.</em> Makes a swap execution facility responsible for monitoring trading in swaps only on its own facility. <p>Repeals the requirement that a swap execution facility set its position limitation at a level no higher than the CFTC limit. Makes a swap execution facility responsible for monitoring positions only on its own facility.

Excludes from the meaning of this kind of &quot;commodity&quot; any security issued by a real estate investment trust, business development company, or issuer of asset-backed securities, including any index of such securities. <p>Excludes from the definition of &quot;Commodity Trading Advisor&quot; any person who serves as an investment adviser to a registered investment company or its subsidiary, if the commodity trading advice relates only to a financial commodity interest. <p>TITLE IV--TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS <p>(Sec. 401) Makes technical and conforming corrections to the CEA. <p>(Sec. 402) Eliminates obsolete references to dealer options. <p>(Sec. 403) Requires each designated contract market and swap execution facility (under current law, the exchange) to publicize, each trading day, the volume of trading on each type of contract for the previous day and any other information the CFTC deems necessary in the public interest. <p>(Sec. 405) Eliminates obsolete references to electronic trading facilities and alternative swap execution facilities. <p>(Sec. 408) Authorizes the CFTC to alter or supplement rules of a registered entity if it finds that the entity has not made changes requested for the protection of swaps traders and to assure fair dealing in swaps. <p>(Sec. 409) Eliminates obsolete references to the Commodity Exchange Commission, derivatives transaction execution facilities, and exempt boards of trade. <p>(Sec. 413) Requires mandatory compliance reports to certify that they are materially accurate and complete (under current law, merely accurate and complete). <p>Repeals the requirement that a compliance report accompany each appropriate financial report of the swap dealer or major swap participant required to be furnished to the CFTC. Requires the furnishing of a compliance report only at such time the CFTC determines by rule, regulation, or order, to be appropriate. <p>(Sec. 414) Makes specified miscellaneous technical corrections to the CEA.]]></text>
