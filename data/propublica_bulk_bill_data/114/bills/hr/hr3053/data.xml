 Directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to revise the Medicare national coverage determination relating to coverage of ventricular assist devices to extend the coverage of such devices under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act for individuals approved for heart transplantation to apply also to: (1) individuals undergoing an evaluation to determine candidacy for heart transplantation; and (2) individuals who would be heart transplant candidates, but are not so eligible because of a contraindication that may be favorably modified by the use of a ventricular assist device.

Directs HHS to use specified processes to revise its national coverage determination relating to ventricular assist devices to incorporate the requirements of this Act.</summary>
