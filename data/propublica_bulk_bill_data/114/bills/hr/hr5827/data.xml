  <summary date="2016-07-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Determination of Russia-Iran Weapons Transfer Act of 2016

This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the sale or transfer of an advanced integrated air defense system to Iran constitutes the sale or transfer of a destabilizing type of advanced conventional weapons system to Iran.

The President shall: (1) notify Congress within 15 days of receiving credible information that any advanced integrated air defense system has been sold or transferred to Iran; and (2) within 30 days of such notification, determine whether the sale or transfer meets sanction imposition requirements and, if so, determine whether to impose or waive sanctions.

 Upon determining that such sale or transfer is not subject to sanctions, the President shall submit a report on the specific reasons for such determination.

Imposed sanctions shall terminate 30 days after the President certifies that Iran and all Iranian-owned or controlled-entities: (1) are not in possession of the system for which sanctions were imposed; and (2) have not transferred such system to a foreign terrorist organization or to a country whose government has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism.</summary>
