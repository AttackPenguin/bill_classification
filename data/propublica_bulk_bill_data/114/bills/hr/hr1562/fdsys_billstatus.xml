          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2015</strong> </p> <p>Requires the head of any executive agency that issues an invitation for bids or a request for proposals for a contract, or that offers a grant, in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, to require each person submitting a bid or proposal or grant application to: (1) certify that such person does not have a seriously delinquent tax debt, and (2) authorize the Department of the Treasury to disclose information limited to describing whether such person has a seriously delinquent tax debt. Subjects a person who has a seriously delinquent tax debt to a negative responsibility determination when applying for a federal contract or grant, or to debarment from the federal procurement process.</p> <p>Defines "seriously delinquent tax debt" as a federal tax liability that has been assessed by the Internal Revenue Service and is collectible by levy or a court proceeding, except a tax debt: (1) that is being paid in a timely manner under an approved installment agreement or an offer-in-compromise, (2) for which a collection due process hearing has been requested or is pending; (3) for which a continuous levy has been issued or agreed to by an applicant for employment, or (4) with respect to which such a levy is released because it has been determined to be an economic hardship to the taxpayer.</p>]]></text>
