Requires the Secretary to expand such model to all states in certain circumstances.</p> <p>(Sec. 517) Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a plan for expanding data in the annual Comprehensive Error Rate Testing program report.</p> <p>(Sec. 518) Amends SSA title XVIII to remove funds for the Medicare Improvement Fund that were added by the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014.</p> Subtitle B--Other Provisions <p>(Sec. 521) Amends the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 to extend certain medical review activities involving the two-midnight rule. (The two-midnight rule allows Medicare coverage only of hospital stays where a physician admits to a hospital a beneficiary expected to require care that crosses two midnights, but generally denies coverage of care expected to require less than a two-midnight stay.) </p> <p>(Sec. 522) Prohibits an entity from submitting a bid for a competitive acquisition area, during calendar 2017-2019, under a competitive DME and prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) acquisition program, unless it has obtained a bid surety bond of between $50,000 and $100,000 for each such area.</p> <p>Requires the forfeit of any bid bond submitted for a competitive acquisition area if the bidding entity does not accept a contract offered for a product category when its composite bid was at or below the median composite bid rate for all bidding entities included in the calculation of the single payment amounts for the product category and the area. Requires the Secretary to collect on the forfeited bond.</p> <p>Requires return of a bid bond within a specified 90-day period to a bidding entity that does not meet such bid forfeiture conditions.</p> <p>Prohibits the Secretary from awarding a contract to any entity that does not meet state licensure requirements. </p> <p>Requires a GAO study on the effect of this bid surety bond requirement on the participation of small suppliers in the Medicare DMEPOS competitive acquisition program.</p> <p>(Sec. 523) Prohibits the Secretary from implementing the final rule requiring the transition of all 10-day and 90-day global surgical packages to 0-day global periods. (A global surgical package, also called global surgery, includes all necessary services normally furnished by a surgeon before, during, and after a procedure, a time-span constituting the global period.)</p> <p>Directs the Secretary through rulemaking to develop and implement a process to gather, from a representative sample of physicians, information needed to value surgical services. </p> <p>(Sec. 524) Extends through FY2015 the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 and payments in lieu of taxes to the governments of states and counties containing tax-exempt federal land.</p> <p>Prescribes a special rule for FY2014 payments.</p> <p>Extends indefinitely requirements for the funding of special projects on federal land for which participating counties elect to expend a portion of such federal funds. Extends through FY2017 the authority to initiate such projects.</p> <p>Extends indefinitely the authorization of appropriations under the Act.</p> <p>(Sec. 525) Prohibits the entry of the budgetary effects of this Act on either PAYGO scorecard maintained under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 or section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress).</p>]]></text>
