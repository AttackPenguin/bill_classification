          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Willing Workers and Willing Employers Act of 2016</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish, for 10 years, an H-2C visa nonimmigrant classification for an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform services or labor in a registered position for a registered non-agricultural employer.</p> <p>An alien may not be admitted as an H-2C nonimmigrant if the alien: </p> <ul> <li>is inadmissible under this Act, </li> <li>fails to pass a criminal or a national security background check, </li> <li> is from a country that has supported acts of international terrorism, or </li> <li>has not received an offer of employment from a registered employer in a registered position. </li> </ul> <p>A registered position is a position for which a registered employer has submitted an H-2C hiring attestation to, and that has been approved by, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). </p> <p>An occupation requiring an individual with a bachelor's degree or higher level of education may not be an eligible H-2C occupation.</p> <p>Employers must: (1) register with DHS, (2) operate in an employment area where the unemployment rate is equal to or less than 4.9%, (3) attest that they have advertised and attempted to recruit qualified U.S. workers, and (4) participate in the E-verify program or an employment verification system patterned upon E-verify. Such employers may: (1) promote an H-2C worker after not less than 12 months on the job, and (2) terminate an H-2C worker at any time for any reason for which it is lawful to terminate U.S. workers.</p>  <p>The maximum number of positions that may be approved for the first fiscal year is 65,000, and the number of positions that may be approved for a subsequent fiscal year may not be less than 45,000 or more than 85,000. </p> <p>The initial period of authorized presence for an H-2C worker is 36 months, with specified renewal periods.</p> <p>A percentage of H-2C positions are reserved for small businesses.</p> <p>The bill prescribes penalties for: (1) H-2C worker violations, revocation of employment status, and removal from the United States; and (2) employer violations, including program ineligibility.</p> <p>An H-2C worker: (1) may travel outside, and be readmitted to, the United States; (2) may not bring family members into the United States who have not received employment offers from a registered employer; (3) must comply with biometric entry and exit requirements; and (4) may terminate employment at any time and accept employment with another registered employer in any other registered position. </p>  <p>DHS shall implement an electronic monitoring system to monitor the presence and employment of H-2C workers. </p>]]></text>
