This bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to revise the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing incentive program, which provides loans to support the production of fuel-efficient, advanced technology vehicles and qualifying components in the United States. The program is expanded by allowing manufacturers of certain fuel-efficient, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (trucks) to qualify for loans. The amount charged as the fee to cover administrative costs is revised.</summary>
