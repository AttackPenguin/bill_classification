This bill amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) to require an electronic communication service provider that has been issued a FISA court order requiring it to produce call detail records (consistent with FISA requirements for the production on an ongoing basis of call detail records created before, on, or after the date of an application by the Federal Bureau of Investigation relating to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism) to notify the Department of Justice if that service provider intends to retain its call detail records for less than 18 months.

Such a notification must be made not less than 180 days prior to the date such service provider intends to implement such a policy.</summary>
