          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Afghanistan Accountability Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>TITLE I--EFFECTIVE AFGHANISTAN ASSISTANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY [<i>sic</i>]</p> <p>(Sec. 102) This bill expresses the sense of Congress with respect to U.S. assistance and accountability in Afghanistan, including that: </p> <ul> <li> the National Unity Government of Afghanistan has made a substantial commitment to reform that should be supported but also subject to heightened scrutiny by the Afghan people and international donors; </li> <li> the international community should work closely with the new government in supporting development priorities; </li> <li>the U.S. government should deepen its dialogue on anti-corruption efforts with the government of Afghanistan, and should encourage Afghanistan's participation in the Open Government Partnership;
