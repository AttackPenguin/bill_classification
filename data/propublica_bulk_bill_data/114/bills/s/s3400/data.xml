  <summary date="2016-09-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2016 

This bill prohibits the President from using the Armed Forces to conduct a first-use nuclear strike unless such strike is conducted pursuant to a congressional declaration of war expressly authorizing such strike.

"First-use nuclear strike" means a nuclear weapons attack against an enemy that is conducted without the President determining that the enemy has first launched a nuclear strike against the United States or a U.S. ally.</summary>
