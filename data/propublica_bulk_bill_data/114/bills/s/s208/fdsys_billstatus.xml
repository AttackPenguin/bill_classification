Requires the BSVC to assess and the Comptroller General to report on the statistical validity of the data and methodology used to develop such metrics.</p> <p>Establishes the BSVC and a special congressional commission on border security to determine the criteria for recommending the three presidential appointees to the BSVC. Terminates the BSVC after determining the accuracy of the tenth annual metrics submission required under this Act.</p> <p>Directs the&nbsp;Border Patrol&nbsp;to impose a consequence for each alien apprehended pursuant to the Border Patrol's Consequence Delivery System. </p> <p>Authorizes the Border Patrol to alter the capability deployment requirements of this Act upon determining that the principal border security threats require alteration.</p> <p>Authorizes the&nbsp;Department of Defense (DOD) to allocate additional DOD aviation assets to the southern border to assist&nbsp;DHS in achieving situational awareness and operational control.</p> <p>Sets personnel levels for the Border Patrol's active duty agents, CBP's Office of Field Operations officers, and CBP's Office of Air and Marine agents.</p> <p>Requires: (1) DHS to ensure a minimum of not fewer than 130,000 annual flight hours of the Office of Air and Marine, and (2) the Office of Air and Marine to operate unmanned aerial systems not less than 16 hours per day, seven days per week.
