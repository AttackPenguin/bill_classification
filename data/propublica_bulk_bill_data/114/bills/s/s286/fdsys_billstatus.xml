          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Department of the Interior Tribal Self-Governance Act of 2015</b></p> <p> Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to revise the Department of the Interior's process for approving self-governance compacts and funding agreements with Indian tribes. </p> <p>Directs Interior to negotiate contracts and funding agreements in good faith to maximize implementation of the self-determination policy.</p> <p>Adds administrative or other expenses incurred by the governing body of the Indian tribe or tribal organization to the contract support costs eligible to receive funding under the Act. </p> <p>Establishes the Tribal Self-Governance Program and sets forth eligibility requirements. Makes tribes eligible to receive grants for planning to participate in the program or for negotiating the terms of participation.</p> <p>Requires funding agreements to specify services to be provided, functions to be performed, and the responsibilities of the Indian tribe and Interior. Permits a funding agreement to provide for a base budget specifying recurring funds to be transferred to the tribe. </p> <p>Directs Interior to enter into a compact with each tribe participating in self-governance in a manner consistent with the trust responsibility of the federal government, treaty obligations, and the government-to-government relationship between tribes and the United States. </p> <p>Specifies requirements for tribes participating in self-governance with respect to conflicts of interest, audits, redesign and consolidation of programs, retrocession of programs, non-duplication of funding, and records.</p> <p>Requires a funding agreement to include provisions for Interior to monitor the performance of trust functions by the tribe and to reassume a program and funding under specified circumstances. </p> <p>Prohibits a tribe from being obligated to continue performance of a compact or funding agreement with insufficient funds.</p> <p> Sets forth requirements for reports, regulations, and judicial review. </p>]]></text>
